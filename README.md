my portfolio web application
I am a very creative, hardworking, honest, driven, result-oriented and organised individual. I take a great deal of my work to achieve results.

I play piano, video games and play soccer.

Yes I do, also I really enjoy the communicational side of working within a team.

I like to multitask, in my personal as well as my professional life. I prefer to have many things going on at once. It keeps me interested and moving forward and with multitasking I am able to focus on the most accurate solution right away;

I want to grow professionally in software development (web/mobile) and build up my skills set, to be employed permanently.



“I really enjoy the communicational side of working within a team. It helps that I work more effectively when trying to generate new ideas when I can work with people that can bounce ideas around and make suggestions that I may have never come up with if I worked alone. I also like the independence of completing any of my own tasks for projects that have been assigned to me. This gives me the free reign to produce my own work that I can take credit for and be proud of upon completion. However, if I feel like I need help I would ask my colleagues for their opinions. I feel like a second opinion will help me see things that I may have missed out on.”
